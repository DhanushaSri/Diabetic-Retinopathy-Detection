# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Python project for diabetic retinopathy detection utilizes image processing, wavelet transform, filtering, and clustering techniques. SVM and KNN classifiers are trained on preprocessed images, achieving 96.62% and 94.38% accuracy respectively. Non-affected images are marked in the dataset, enhancing classification performance. These methodologies collectively provide an effective framework for accurate diabetic retinopathy detection and diagnosis in medical imaging applications.
